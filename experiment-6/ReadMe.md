In this experiment, the aim was to learn prolog programming, prolog has been used for logic 
programming.Here I performed list operations using prolog such as removing duplicates from 
list, slicing a list, creating subsets of list of given size and also to generate huffman code for 
the given symbols. Also I used prolog to genrate a family tree and wrote the required rules 
and then executed the queries. Basically the three basic contructs of Prolog are rules,facts and 
queries. The Prolog programs are basically knowledge bases, consisting of rules, facts and 
queries are asked to which the answer is seeked fro mthis knowledge base and a boolean 
value is sent.

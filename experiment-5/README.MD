Experiment-5

In this experiment, the aim is to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm and to run the algorithm on a random dataset which in this case is a dataset containing the annual income and spending score of mall customers. Then using k-means algorithm, for k values 1-10, I calculated the within cluster sum of squares(WCSS) values and plotted the Elbow Method graph which helps to find out the optimal number of clusters which comes out to be 5 using the graph.

Then using this k value the graph with 5 clusters for annual income and spending score is plotted and all the centroids along with their data points are plotted. Using matplotlib, I also have plotted graphs for other k values also and placed these images them in them document and can also be viewed in the jupyter notebook.

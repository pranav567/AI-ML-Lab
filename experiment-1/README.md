In this experiment I learnt about agents in ai, types of agents and implemented a simple 
reflex agent which using the current state and performs actions based on each condition.
The agent detects vehicles or obstacles in front of the vehicle and tries to control the speed 
of the vehicle. Here the environment for the agent is two lane road.

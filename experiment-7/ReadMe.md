In this experiment I learned about Expert systems. It is an interactive computer-based decision-making system which uses both facts and heuristics to solve complex decision-making problems. The given question has data about the amount of rainfall in a city and in which region the city lies in. In the above code, first all the names of cities and regions were stored which were mentioned in the problem statement and then the facts are stored. Then using the query in the above code, we can find the name of city from the amount of rainfall and vice-versa, also we can find the region from the city-name and vice-versa. Prolog makes it easier to find answers to these queries once the facts have been stored and using these facts it finds the solution.

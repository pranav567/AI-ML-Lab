Experiment 2

In this experiment, an intelligent agent that uses bfs or dfs in any functionality was to be built. The agent chosen for the same is a driving agent. For the implementation, python is used and for demonstration purposes, turtle library of python was used.

The environment for this experiment consists of a 4-lane highway, all the vehicles on either sides and rear are ignored only the vehicles ahead of the agent is considered. The initial position of the vehicle is in the left lane assuming it has just started. The agent is considered as the root node and the empty lanes ahead as the child nodes. When all the lanes are full the agent does not change lanes and maintains the same speed. When there are empty lanes, using DFS the agent selects the first empty lane it finds and increases speed and changes lanes and continues in the same. Using BFS, the agent chooses the empty lane that is close to the lane in which the agent is and increases speed and changes lane and continues in the same. This environment is restricted for only straight roads, uniform speed for other vehicles and 4 lanes in this case but can be done for any number of lanes also there is no case that covers accidents as the agent does not change lanes unless it finds an empty lane. The environment also assumes that the roads have a proper divider and the agent only detects vehicles and lanes on the side of divider where it is present.
